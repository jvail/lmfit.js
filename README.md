lmfit.js
========

JavaScript (emscripten) port of lmfit library:

"a self-contained C library for Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization and curve fitting" (quote http://apps.jcns.fz-juelich.de/doku/sc/lmfit)

Currently only curve fitting is implemented. Some examples: http://jvail.github.io/dairy.js/,  https://m0ose.github.io/lmfit.js/test2.html

## missing features

- surface fitting as example for minimization with lmmin()
- nonlinear equations solving with lmmin()
